# diaphragm-pump-tester

This project was designed to provide a GUI for operators to run lifecycle testing on a diaphragm fluid pump. 
The pumps were controlled using a Raspberry Pi with a simple breakout board.
Requirements included generating an appropriate PWM signal to control the pump speed, read back the pump RPM through a tachometer signal generated by the pump, 
and provide data logging to csv files for later use.

### Structure

The code was all written in Python to be run on the RPi. The main code can be found in [pump_tester.py](/pump_tester.py), which initializes the GUI and begins the main loop. 
The GUI was written using the tkinter library, and is contained in [gui.py](/gui.py) along with most of the program logic. 
The files [logger.py](/logger.py) and [dia_pump.py](/dia_pump.py) were helper classes written to handle data logging and controlling the diaphragm pumps respectively.
